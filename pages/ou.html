    <a class="fighter_description">Three years removed from winning the undisputed cruiserweight championship, Usyk picked up three pieces of the heavyweight title last October, stunning Anthony Joshua in a one-sided fight.
        In his third fight in the division, Usyk looked elite, blending high-level skills—Usyk won gold in the 2012 Olympics at heavyweight—with a filled-out frame.
        After spending most of March in Ukraine, Usyk, 35, has left his country to begin training camp for the rematch with Joshua, tentatively scheduled for July.</a>
