    <a class="fighter_description">Critics will say Álvarez should drop further on this list after his nine-year, 17-fight unbeaten streak came to an end May 7.
         But Álvarez chased greatness when he moved up in weight (again) to challenge arguably the top light heavyweight in boxing when there were safer, more marketable options at 168 pounds. 
         He lost, but Canelo’s résumé remains the best in boxing, and his status as the undisputed super middleweight champion remains intact. 
        Álvarez says he will exercise his rematch clause with Bivol, though there may be internal discussions about whether Álvarez, 31, who began his career fighting in the low 140s, should reconsider campaigning at 175 pounds.</a>
