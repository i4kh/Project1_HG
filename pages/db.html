    <a class="fighter_description">Bivol, 31, had solid credentials before defeating Álvarez. 
        He was a decorated amateur with pro wins over Joe Smith Jr., Sullivan Barrera and Jean Pascal.
        Against Álvarez, Bivol showcased his full arsenal, utilizing speed, power and precise combination punching to hand Álvarez his second professional defeat. Bivol is contractually obligated to a rematch, but if Álvarez elects to drop back to super middleweight, Bivol could face the winner of next month’s unification fight between Smith and Artur Beterbiev.</a>
